# Linux Trail
Linux Trail is a distro based on Debian stable that uses the Gnome3 Classic as the default desktop environment.
If you want a stable, well-stocked and developer-friendly OS, this is for you!

<h5>BUILT FOR DEVELOPMENT</h5>
Autokey, Apache, PHP, MySQL, Ruby on Rails, Python, Git, Wine and tools like Geany, CodeLite, Monodevelop, Visual Studio Code and an extension generator for it and for ASP.NET 5 as well come pre-installed, so you can immediately start programming and developing your projects. You got also OpenJDK if you want to work with a Java based IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans.

<h5>GNOME 3 ENHANCED EXPERIENCE</h5>
Gnome 3 Classic is the chosen desktop environment with some tweaks. You can promptly work with remote desktop areas,
switch easily between them, access your favorite apps on the top bar as well as the gnome menu, applications and places.
You also have a middle top panel to have immediate access to all your apps and services, a launcher creator, a text editor (gedit) and the terminal.

<h5>DESKTOP READY</h5>
As soon as you install Linux Trail you are ready to go. You can play your music, video, organize and edit your images,
create documents, program, surf the web and many many more. You can install your '.deb' packages with Gdebi, search for
programs with gpk and install them with terminal or Synaptic.

It comes with most of the tools you need for your work (for developers, coders, programmers, 
distribution testers, so forth). It is the list:
